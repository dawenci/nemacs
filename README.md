# nemacs
Minimal emacs keys extension for VSCode on Mac with better mark/region support.

Source: https://github.com/naturalethic/nemacs

Please see `package.json` for a list of keys commands.  These were seeded from [this project](https://github.com/nana4gonta/emacs-visual-studio-code).

A recent change to ctrl+k/ctrl+y behavior has turned this into a Mac-only extension.
If anyone would like to help port this to other platforms:

**Contributions welcome.**
