# nemacs
Minimal emacs keys extension for VSCode with better mark/region support.

Source: https://github.com/naturalethic/nemacs

Please see `package.json` for a list of keys commands.  These were seeded from [this project](https://github.com/nana4gonta/emacs-visual-studio-code).

I use a Mac, so these may not work well on other platforms.

**Contributions welcome.**
